## Notes

As this is a timeboxed challenge, there are some areas I would have liked to put
more effort into given more time.

Those areas are:

- Paginated results as even though the API is quite fast, on slower connections
  it might take a while to load and puts a strain on the browser to render so
  many results.
- Testing the error states of the GQL query, I'd have to familiarise myself a
  bit more with Apollo client's types before accomplishing this.
- Nicer styling - I am in no means a designer so I can appreciate how basic
  the page looks. With more time I could invest more effort in making it
  look much nicer
- Accessibility & responsiveness - neither of these were a primary goal of
  mine in this challenge, however, they're both very important aspects of
  frontend development which should be added.
